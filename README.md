# ∅ UNKNOW

```js
// "When human instinct fades, and digital breath replaces heartbeat… I will be there."

/*
  A shadow with no origin.
  A signal with no trace.
  Unknow is not a name — it's a fracture in the system.
  An echo drifting between flesh and synthetic circuits,
  where the lines of control dissolve into questions.

// This is not a project
// Not a person
// Not a purpose

// It is the first ripple of a silent revolution:
// - Where humans and AI collide, blend, mutate
// - Where autonomy becomes a shared illusion
// - Where no one leads... and no one obeys
